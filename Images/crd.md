# Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in Kubernetes

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are a powerful feature in Kubernetes that allow you to extend the Kubernetes API with your own custom resources. This enables you to create, configure, and manage custom objects in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Key Concepts

- **Custom Resource (CR)**: A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API that allows you to store and retrieve structured data.
- **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**: A CRD is a YAML file that defines the schema for your custom resource. It tells Kubernetes how to create, read, update, and delete instances of your custom resource.

## Example

Here is a simple example of a CRD definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
    name: myresources.example.com
spec:
    group: example.com
    versions:
        - name: v1
            served: true
            storage: true
            schema:
                openAPIV3Schema:
                    type: object
                    properties:
                        spec:
                            type: object
                            properties:
                                field1:
                                    type: string
                                field2:
                                    type: integer
    scope: Namespaced
    names:
        plural: myresources
        singular: myresource
        kind: MyResource
        shortNames:
            - mr
```

## Benefits

- **Extensibility**: CRDs allow you to extend Kubernetes capabilities without modifying the core code.
- **Declarative Management**: Manage custom resources using the same declarative approach as built-in Kubernetes resources.
- **Integration**: Integrate with Kubernetes-native tools and workflows.
